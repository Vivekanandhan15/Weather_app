4. Get current weather details instantly

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Purpose

This project was built to practice **API integration** and improve front-end development skills.  
It helped me understand asynchronous JavaScript using `fetch()`, DOM manipulation, and how to handle live data.

It also demonstrates my ability to build useful, real-world applications from scratch.
